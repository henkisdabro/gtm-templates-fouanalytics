Google Tag Manager (Web) tag template for loading the FouAnalytics JS library. It's simply a template "wrapper" to offer a safe(r) way to load the javascript library as opposed to using the Custom HTML tag when deploying FouAnalytics. This is not an official template. Feedback is welcome.

Thanks for Dr. Augustine Fou for building a great product. Read more about the service here and consider supporting his work.
